# Under development

**_In its current state, this theme should only be used for referencing odd bits of code. I'll change this notice after a general theme skeleton is complete and split a dev branch for continued development, but until then Cellular 9.x is experimental._**

# Cellular

### a sweet starter theme for Drupal

## Getting Started

Download or git or otherwise install the theme to `yourCoreInstall/themes`

Install with:
composer `composer require drupal/cellular`or npm `npm install cellular`

After the project installs, the build task will run to generate the theme distribution files from `/src`.

## Building Cellular

To rebuild the theme completely from src, use the command `npm run build` (**_all changes will be overwritten to theme.info.yml, theme.breakpoints.yml, and `//dist`_**, always edit the `/src` files!\*).

To rebuild parts of the theme as changes are made, use the command `npm run watch` (**_all changes will be overwritten to theme.info.yml, theme.breakpoints.yml, and `//dist`_**, always edit the `/src` files!\*).

## npm tasks

Tasks are run from the cellular directory on the command line using `npm run {{command}}`

- `clean` removes `/dist/`
- `postcss` autoprefixes and lints css
- `mincss` minifies css in `/dist/`
- `sass` compiles `src/sass/` to `/dist/css/`
- `lint` runs all lint commands
- `lint:js` lints js
- `lint:css` lints css
- `lint:sass` lints sass
- `uglify` compiles `src/js/` to `/dist/js/app.js`
- `imagemin` optimizes `/src/assets/images/` to `dist/assets/images`
- `icons` optimizes `src/assets/icons` to `dist/assets/icons` and creates a png for a fallback image
- `build:style-dictionary` generates `theme.info.yml`, `theme.breakpoints.yml`, `src/sass/variables/_style-dictionary.scss`, and `src/js/style-dictionary.json`
- `build:css` removes existing dist css, then compiles/autoprefixes/minifies css
- `build:js` removes existing dist css, then compiles js
- `build:php`
- `build:assets` runs imagemin && icons _&& Copy to dist/assets_
- `build` removes current dist and runs all build tasks to generate theme files based on style dictionary parameters.
- `serve` runs test server
- `watch:sass` compiles css on save to `/src/sass/`
- `watch:js` compiles app.jss on save to `/src/js/`
- `watch:images` optimize icons/images on save.
- `watch` compile js & sass

### Style-dictionary

The style-dictionary is the backbone of cellular's build system, with sass and js actually doing the work based on settings generated by style-dictionary.

The settings in `/src/style-dictionary/tokens` are used to constrain/organize sass variables.

The settings in `/src/style-dictionary/drupal` are used to simplify creating info, breakpoint, layout, etc. yml files to configure/customize your Drupal theme.

### Sass

`src/sass/style.scss` (and other top-level scss documents) import each index in order to compile optimized cascading styles.

All Sass styles are separated logically into their own partials, which are imported by that directories' `_index.scss` ().

- Style-dictionary is the ultimate source of truth for variables.
- Modularity is crucial for managing large code bases...
  - Collecting styles as ordered partials allows styles to cascade properly... Each subset of styles is collected in `__index.sass`
  - Let the styles flow: They're easier to manage that way.

### JS

A template is included for handling custom script with drupal/jquery, and a separate template for controlling plugins. The `/src/js/` directory will be compiled to `/dist/js/app.js`

- script.js, plugins.js need to be configured to receive Drupal settings
- cellular-ui plugin development

### Theme functions

- Inject critical css in <head> (frontpage & others)
- Conditional ie stylesheet
- Pass theme settings as json to js
- Play nice with layout builder

### Templates

- Templates for most common elements (_block, article, node, etc._) are provided in the `/templates` directory.
